 abstract = {Perhaps the best known approach for tackling the human and organisational aspects of projects is through the use of {\dq}critical success factors{\dq} but although the approach has very many champions it is not without its critics. This paper sets out the findings of a major review of the sets of factors that are available and outlines the main reservations that have been expressed about the approach. It then shows how a systems model, the Formal Systems Model, can be used as a framing device to deliver the benefits of taking account of {\dq}critical success factors{\dq} whilst at the same time avoiding the problems associated with {\dq}critical success factors{\dq} that give rise to the criticisms. Two IS projects are used to demonstrate use of this framing devise. When observation began at the start of the projects they looked very similar and equally likely to succeed. In the event, one of the projects was largely successful across the whole of the range of measures normally used to judge success whilst the other exhibited most of the characteristics of failure. Analysis using the framing device is well able to demonstrate the marked differences in the ways the two projects were managed and to account for stark contrast in the levels of success achieved. The paper concludes that the Formal System Model allows the underlying benefits of {\dq}critical success factors{\dq} to be secured whilst overcoming most of the problems associated with a checklist approach.

@article{vanScoter.2011,
 abstract = {Projects are used by most organizations for unique, one of a kind, tasks. As projects get larger with respect to time, cost, number of locations, technology difficulty, etc., the probability of success decreases. This has been especially seen in IT projects and those projects requiring a change in individual job tasks. An example of this is the low success rate of ERP projects. Critical Success Factors (CSFs) have been used to focus the project manager's attention on the project areas with the largest impact on project success. CSFs are those things that must be done right for the project to be successful - they are required but are not sufficient to guarantee success. The published research results related to CSFs, using data obtained from a number of different organizations in each study, are inconsistent due in part to organizational and project characteristic differences. This has made CSFs less useful than they could and should be. This paper will discuss the history of CSF usage, the divergent research paths between theory and practice in the identification of project CSFs and set direction for future research.

 abstract = {In the field of information systems (IS) there is an observable trend towards the use of multi-method research. Using different research methods allows for the cross-validation of data obtained via multiple approaches, with the potential to increase the robustness of research results. Such a multi-method approach is applicable to a comprehensive research agenda on critical success factors, an agenda that needs to take into account not only the identification, but also the analysis and management of critical success factors. The goal of this article is to contribute new knowledge on how to carry out research on critical success factors in IS projects using a multi-method approach. For this purpose, two research projects are presented, each a variation of the research design customized to particular circumstances. First, there is an outline of the research approach taken for a critical success factor research project in the field of portal implementation, with discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the project. Taking into consideration these experiences, the research approach of a similar critical success factor research project in the field of offshore software development is then described. Finally, recommendations for using the multi-method research approach in critical success factor research are presented.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Chow.2008,
 abstract = {While software is so important for all facets of the modern world, software development itself is not a perfect process. Agile software engineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way of developing software as compared to the traditional methodologies. However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in this subject is still scant in the academic circles. This research study was a survey study on the critical success factors of Agile software development projects using quantitative approach.
Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential critical success factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled. Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted to consolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possible critical success factors for each of the four project success categories -- Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost.
A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey data from 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world. Multiple regression techniques were used, both at the full regression model and at the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure. The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported, identifying three critical success factors for Agile software development projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile Software Engineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability.
Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations for practitioners. To ensure success of their projects, managers are urged to focus on choosing a high-caliber team, practicing Agile engineering techniques and following Agile-style delivery strategy.},

@article{Belassi.1996,
 abstract = {Only a few studies in the project management literature concentrate on the critical factors that affect project success or failure. Whereas many of these studies generate lists of critical success factors, each list varies in its scope and purpose. The success factors are usually listed as either very general factors or very specific factors affecting only a particular project. However, lacking a comprehensive list makes it difficult not only for project managers but also for researchers to evaluate projects based on these factors. In this study, we suggest a new scheme that classifies the critical factors, and describes the impacts of these factors on project performance. Emphasis is given to the grouping of success factors and explaining the interaction between them, rather than the identification of individual factors. An empirical study is conducted to test the practicality of using such a scheme. The statistical analyses of the results demonstrate the differences between the critical success factors identified in a previous study from literature and the factors identified with the use of our scheme. Many critical factors, such as factors related to project managers' performance, factors related to team members and environmental factors, became apparent with this study. The results are encouraging, in that practitioners support the use of this scheme for determining and analysing critical success factors and how systems respond to these factors.},

@article{Sudhakar.2012,
 abstract = {Purpose -- Existing models of critical success factors of software projects have less concentration on communication, team, project management and product related factors. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model of critical success factors (CSFs) for software development projects, categorize the success factors, finding the factors in each category and highlighting the product, team, project management and communication factors as important categories of success factors for software projects. Design/methodology/approach -- A conceptual model and seven categories of success factors comprising a total of 80 success factors for software development projects were identified based on the thorough literature review. These 80 factors are collected based on their importance to software projects and their repeated occurrence in the literature related to CSFs. Based on the occurrence of the success factor in the literature, each category comprising top five success factors are identified as critical success factors for software projects. Based on these seven categories of success factors a conceptual model was developed. Findings -- A total of 35 CSFs from seven CSF categories are identified from secondary research of the CSFs for software development projects. The identified CSFs include communication in project, top management support, clear project goal, reliability of output, project planning, teamwork, project team coordination, quality control, client acceptance, accuracy of output, reduce ambiguity, maximize stability, realistic expectations and user involvement. Project management, product, team and communication factors are identified as important categories of success factors for software projects. Research limitations/implications -- Different categories of critical success factors such as product, project management, team and communication, which were not highlighted or categorized earlier in the literature are discussed in this current work. Practical implications -- This research is definitely useful for organizations working on software projects. The project managers working in the industry can benefit from the mentioned critical success factors and the categories of factors by concentration on them while planning and executing software projects. Originality/value -- The conceptual model, categorization of CSFs, identifying 35 CSFs for software projects and highlighting product, team and communication factors are major contributions of this research work.
